	<p>
		At the onset of the Internet age, most web developers were dubbed full stack developers. In the 1970s and 80s, it was common for a single person to craft a software program from start to finish because there weren’t many layers of complexity between the computer’s hardware and the programmer.
However, as applications became increasingly elaborate, full stack development began to waver in its ubiquity. The advent of client-server computing in the nineties, coupled with the rising popularity of the net, necessitated the emergence of trained specialists. Programmers were subdivided based on the company’s stack: Networks, the front end, databases, and servers were all managed by distinct departments.
The diversified trend only started to reverse in the late 2000s. New technologies became streamlined, allowing aspiring developers to construct a fully fledged application in a shorter period. Gone were the days of the Java stack and Oracle databases — instead, high-powered databases like MySQL, PHP, and Ruby on Rails claimed the spotlight.
In recent years, the rarefied full stack developer has become significantly more critical. Employers understand their centrality; after all, every team benefits from at least one individual with a holistic knowledge of a project’s parts. Full stack developers have a special knack for drawing together various tech tiers into a neatly packaged application.
